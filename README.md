Browser extension that saves tabs in group temporarily.

Have you ever opened too much tabs in your browser? When we are working, we will usually open many tabs that're about a single subject. Unfortunately, sometimes we can't finish the work at once and need to keep those tabs open. As the tabs accumulate, it becomes a mess. And this extention aims to solve this problem.

The new Edge browser has already have a built-in functionality called Collections, which I think is very practical. So this extension is pretty much referencing the Edge Collections.
